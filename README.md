# Black-Friday-Insights-into-Customer-Predictions
Through our project, we plan to demonstrate an industry followed standard CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining) procedure in order to understand the existing trend of data, analyze the results according to the data clusters and to generate predictions for customer purchases. This is interesting because, to keep up with the competition, retailers need some insights and cluster of customers to cluster them into groups and to target them. So, retailers can use different marketing strategies to attract different types of customers. With our findings, we represent a view of how a retailer can choose from products that will be most popular, advertise them to the right group and also include multiple offers and deals to maximize the profit.
